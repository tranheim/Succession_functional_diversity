This directory contains the processed data used in the analyses described above. Raw sequencing reads can be found on the NCBI SRA under BioProject PRJNA1238768 (amplicon sequences) and PRJEB56463 in SRA (shotgun sequences) under the project ID . The processed data and source data have been deposited
